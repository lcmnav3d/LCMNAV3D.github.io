    faq: [
      ['Can Unreal\'s navmesh handle flying AI at all?',
       'Only by approximating it. A navmesh describes a walkable surface, so any flying behaviour built on it is really surface navigation with an offset, or a set of stacked surfaces with hand-authored transitions. That is fine for a hover drone following terrain and inadequate for anything that has to choose its altitude.'],
      ['Do I have to choose between Recast and LCM Nav3D?',
       'No. They coexist in the same level and are designed to. Ground agents run on Recast, flying agents run on the sparse voxel octree, and a crowd avoidance bridge lets Unreal\'s Detour RVO crowd system see the flying agents.'],
      ['Why an octree instead of a simple 3D grid?',
       'Density. A uniform grid spends the same memory on empty sky as on solid geometry, and the cost grows with the cube of the extent. The octree is sparse: one node covers a large empty region and it only subdivides where there is something to subdivide around, so navigation data is driven by how cluttered the level is rather than how big it is.'],
      ['Does LCM Nav3D replace Unreal\'s navigation system?',
       'No, it sits beside it. Recast, Behavior Trees, StateTree, EQS, AI Perception, Mass and the Gameplay Debugger all keep working as they do now. LCM Nav3D adds tasks, tests, traits and a debugger category to them rather than substituting for them.'],

    // Answers are drawn verbatim from the Quick Triage table and sections 1-7 on

    faq: [
      ['Why does my LCM Nav3D agent not move at all?',
       'The usual cause is that there is no navigation manager in the level. If the Output Log shows "LCMBTTask_FlyTo: No SVO Manager found in the level!", drag an LcmNavigationManagerSVO into the level - one per level, required. Then check that the AI possessed the pawn (Auto Possess AI is set, an AI Controller Class is assigned, and the controller actually runs the tree), that the pawn has a movement component supporting flight with a non-zero Max Speed, and that the goal was actually set.'],
      ['Why does LCM Nav3D report "no path found" through a gap I can clearly see?',
       'Clearance Padding sealed the opening. When Clearance Padding is close to Min Voxel Size, obstacle inflation fills narrow openings completely - a 2 m doorway with 100 cm voxels and 100 cm padding can vanish entirely. Lower Clearance Padding, or lower Min Voxel Size so the opening survives the inflation, then confirm with Draw Debug Volumes that free voxels run through the opening.'],
      ['Why do short paths work while long ones fail?',
       'This is almost always an infinite-world issue: the route crosses chunks that have not generated yet. Turn on Persistent Skeleton under section 5, Coarse Skeleton - it is off by default and is what allows long-range planning before the detail exists. For routing to be complete on the first frame, tick Use Baked Skeleton and click Bake Skeleton. Tick Assist Infinite Streaming on the Fly To task for agents that must traverse the frontier.'],
      ['Why do my agents fly straight through walls?',
       'If agents fly through a wall, the wall is not in the octree. Voxelization uses collision, not visual geometry, so a mesh set to No Collision is invisible to navigation. Check that the mesh has collision and that its channel is listed in Obstacle Query Channels under section 3, Collision.'],
      ['Why are my moving obstacles ignored by LCM Nav3D agents?',
       'The moving actor is missing the Dynamic Obstacle component. Add an LCM Nav3D Dynamic Obstacle component to any actor that should push agents aside as it moves.'],
      ['Why can I not find the LCM Nav3D demo maps?',
       'Show Plugin Content is switched off in the Content Browser. Enable it, and the worked examples appear under the plugin’s Content/Demo/ folder, grouped by Behaviour Tree, StateTree and Mass Entity.'],
      ['Why did my frame rate drop after adding LCM Nav3D?',
       'Voxel resolution is too fine. Raise Min Voxel Size - finer voxels multiply the node count sharply - and re-measure before tuning anything else.'],
      ['Why does my agent jitter or vibrate in place?',
