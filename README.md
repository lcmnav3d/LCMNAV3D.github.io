## Regenerating metadata

Page titles, meta descriptions, canonical URLs, Open Graph and Twitter tags,
JSON-LD structured data, breadcrumbs, image dimensions, the sitemap, the Atom
feed and the search index are all **generated**. Do not hand-edit them — edit the
source and re-run the build:

```bash
node tools/build.js .     # rewrite metadata across all pages
node tools/verify.js .    # check links, anchors, structured data, SEO rules
node tools/lint.js .      # check content for conversion residue and broken tables
```

`tools/build.js` is idempotent: running it twice in a row reports `0` changes the
second time. `verify.js` and `lint.js` both exit non-zero on a problem, so they can
gate a commit. Run all three before every push.

`lint.js` exists because the Markdown-to-HTML conversion silently dropped several
tables — any table cell containing a literal `|` (Unreal's `Category | Node`
naming) broke the Markdown parser and the table came through as a paragraph of raw
pipes. The lint catches that, plus unconverted `**bold**`, `](links)`, empty table
columns, mismatched column counts, unbalanced tags and mojibake.

To change a page's title or description, edit `tools/seo-pages.js` and re-run the
build. To change the site URL, the author, or the Search Console token, edit the
constants at the top of `tools/build.js`.

## Editing content

Page bodies are plain HTML between `<main id="content">` and `<div class="pager">`.
Edit those directly, then re-run `tools/build.js` so the search index picks up the
new text.

**Adding a page** takes two edits, both in `tools/seo-pages.js`: add an entry to
`PAGES` (title, description, breadcrumb, sidebar label) and drop the filename into
the right group in `NAV`. Then create the HTML with a minimal skeleton and run the
build — the sidebar, the prev/next pager, the breadcrumb, the whole `<head>`, the
sitemap, the feed, `llms.txt` and the search index are all regenerated from those
two definitions, on every page. The build refuses to run if `PAGES` and `NAV`
disagree, so a page can never be half-registered.

## Deployment

GitHub Pages serves the repository root of the default branch. See
[`SEO.md`](SEO.md) for the post-deploy Search Console steps.
